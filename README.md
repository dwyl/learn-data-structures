# learn-data-structures
Learn about data structures and algorithms, and the effects they can have on code performance

## *Why*?

Data structures and algorithms play a massive role in any and every programming
language. With a better understanding of both you can pick the ones that best
suit your needs and massively speed up your applications.

**Better hardware is not a solution**

Better hardware can only do so much. No matter how powerful your hardware is,
it is not going to make up for an inefficient algorithm.

The right choices in data structure and algorithm could be the difference
between something being processed in seconds or hours.

## *What*?

### Data Structures

> Data is a broad term that refers to all types of information down to the most
basic numbers and strings.

[Data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure), refer to how
data is organised.

```elixir
hello = "hello" # data
world = "world" # data

[hello, world] # data structure
```

### Algorithms

Simply put, an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) is a set of
steps for solving a problem. You would used an algorithm for making a sandwich
for example:

```
1 - Grab 2 slices of bread
2 - Butter each slice
3 - Put filling on top of one of the slices
4 - Put other slice on top of filling ðŸ¥ª
```


In computing an algorithm is the same thing. Just a set of steps for a computer
program to accomplish a task.

There are often a number of ways your could accomplish a task so learning to
pick the right algorithm is a key.
